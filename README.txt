== Shop Customer features 
The CoinbarPay Payment Gateway plugin allows for both on-chain and off-chain types of payments. This means that users have the option to use their private wallet or the Coinbar wallet for transactions.

The Coinbar wallet is an account on the Coinbar Exchange Platform that allows users to hold, trade, deposit, withdraw, and pay with their preferred coin.

When using a private wallet, after the checkout process, the user is prompted to confirm the final payment price, choose a cryptocurrency to pay with, and confirm the payment request. This generates a QR code for the user to scan and use their private wallet as the payment source.

When using the Coinbar Wallet, the user will need to log in to the system and use funds that have been previously deposited.
